CS261 Final Portfolio Assignment

This project was to implement a hashmap that stores the count of the occurence of every word in a text document.
The program will return to the user the top 10 occurring words in the document.
This program is case-insensitive.

The program will return an array of tuples. The tuples will be a pair consisting of the word and its respective count.
